# Learning Platform

This is a personal project, for making simple cards that you can use in the app or generate a paper to cut out these.
Also for more then this but this platform is still in progress

Open Source and Free to use.

Currently you can view cards and do a writing test with them and switch the text, now you can only add cards/collections through a database.

## TODO:
* Ability to add cards and collections without using database
* PDF Upload for books.
* Book viewer
* Book marker

Suggestions are welcome.
